                                automated content scheduling system for MMBC's TikTok and Instagram platforms,
                                implementing A/B testing to optimize posting times and content types. This led to a 103%
                                increase in interaction and reach, growing our follower base from 450 to over 1,000
                                within three months. I led a team of over 10 members to launch successful campaigns such
                                as 'New Music Friday' and 'Artist Spotlights,' resulting in a 68% increase in Instagram
                                engagement and a notable rise in Spotify followers. Additionally, I spearheaded a
                                website revamp, which boosted digital engagement by 35%.

                            <p> SongSync aims to solve the challenge of finding the ideal playlist for any mood,
                                offering a
                                unique and tailored musical journey every time.
                                It is a web application designed to revolutionize playlist creation through advanced
                                audio
                                analysis and mood-based curation.
                                
                                <p>The project involves implementing various methods to sort and manage audio tracks
                                effectively, focusing on features such as energy, tempo, and danceability to ensure each
                                playlist is harmonically and rhythmically cohesive.
                                By integrating with the Spotify API, SongSync accesses users' top artists and creates
                                personalized playlists directly on their profiles.
                                The application employs sophisticated algorithms to match users' selected moods with
                                tracks
                                from their favorite artists, computing mood scores to curate the perfect listening
                                experience.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Design Process:</strong> I started development with SongSync by identifying the
                                need for a more personalized music experience that adapts to user mood and preferences.
                                After researching user behavior on music platforms, I initiated a series of
                                brainstorming sessions to outline key features. Early prototypes were built using React
                                and tested for usability. After refining the UI based on feedback, I integrated Spotify API to fetch and analyze user data, ensuring seamless
                                playlist creation. The project's frontend was styled with CSS for an engaging and
                                intuitive user interface.</p>

                            <p> Along with a team of passionate innovators at the intersection of technology and
                                education, we created M-Scribe, a Chrome extension designed to revolutionize the way 
                                students interact with their academic content. 
                                
                                <p>This tool enhances UMich lecture experiences by combining a React
                                frontend with a Flask backend, incorporating cutting-edge AI technologies for real-time lecture
                                analysis and summarization. M-Scribe not only reduces student study time by 40% but also
                                improves comprehension through features like advanced AI-driven note-taking and content
                                summarization. It's about making every study session as productive as possible, freeing
                                up
                                time for what truly matters to students.</p>

                            <p><strong>Design Process:</strong> MScribe was conceived to enhance the educational
                                experience by facilitating better engagement with lecture content. The project began
                                with a thorough analysis of student needs through surveys and one-on-one interviews,
                                which highlighted the demand for advanced note-taking and content summarization tools.
                                We developed prototypes using Plasmo and CSS and refined our approach through multiple rounds of user
                                feedback and functional enhancements. </p>

                            <p> In my role with the Kappa Theta Pi Life App, I focused on enhancing user experience and
                                administrative efficiency. I engineered a streamlined account management system with
                                bulk
                                deletion capabilities, which significantly improved control over data management.
                                Additionally, I pioneered the development of iOS widgets and transformed comprehensive
                                search functionality using Dart/Flutter. 
                                
                                <p>This work not only enhanced navigation
                                efficiency
                                for our members but also integrated Google Sheets API for more efficient updating of

                                more effective tool for our fraternity members.</p>

                            <p><strong>Design Process:</strong> The concept for the Kappa Theta Pi Life App emerged from
                                the need to streamline fraternity management tasks. Initial brainstorming sessions
                                focused on identifying key features that could address everyday challenges faced by
                                fraternity members. User interviews helped refine our understanding and prioritize
                                functionalities, leading to the creation of initial prototypes using Figma. Subsequent
                                testing phases allowed us to iterate on design and functionality, ensuring a
                                user-friendly experience that met the needs of our members.</p>

                                I designed an Airbnb-style application, showcasing available apartments
                                and homes for lease in Ann Arbor.
                                To simplify the process of finding and leasing properties, I incorporated location-based
                                search and filtering features.

                                For the drone delivery simulation, the project focused on optimizing
                                delivery routes using graph-based algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's
                                to determine the most efficient paths. Additionally, it tackled
                                the Traveling Salesman problem to further refine route optimization.

                                In this project, we developed a simplified SQL-like program, called SillyQL, for
                                managing
                                databases.
                                The program used hash tables to handle large datasets efficiently, mimicking real-world
                                database management
                                systems in processing queries and managing data.</p>

                                This project required us to implement priority queues using various methods,
                                including the Poor man's method, a sorted method, a binary heap method, and a pairing
                                heap
                                method,
                                to simulate an efficient escape route from a mine in case of an emergency.</p>
