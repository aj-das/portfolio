                Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Arinjoy (AJ) Das, a senior studying Computer Science at the University of
                Michigan. Go Blue! From an early age, I've been passionate about blending technology with my interests.
                My journey in Computer Science, sparked by an interest in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, led
                me to the University of Michigan. My work lives at the intersection of tech, storytelling, and culture.
            </p>
             <p class="description">
                This summer, I worked at Wells Fargo as a Technology Program Intern in Consumer Technology. I was able to 
                develop and optimize a Python-based Coverage Analysis Tool to automate scenario matching between Jira and 
                Confluence datasets, improving audit traceability and reducing manual review time by 94%, saving over 208 
                hours in total effort. My interest in fintech stems from a desire to work on systems that directly affect 
                users and demand both technical precision and responsible innovation.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Previously, I interned at 740 Project, a marketing agency under Capitol Music Group, where I conducted performance 
                audits and developed SEO-backed campaigns that led to a 70% increase in artist engagement. This experience gave me 
                a unique perspective on how data, technology, and culture intersect to drive user behavior.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                On campus, I currently serve as Co-President of the Michigan Music Business Club (MMBC), where I lead 90+ members 
                across five teams. Iâ€™ve overseen partnerships with artists like Don Toliver, Cordae, and 24kGoldn, launched a podcast 
                and newsletter with 2,000+ subscribers, and executed a full-scale digital strategy that more than quadrupled our online 
                reach. I also serve as Director of App Development for Kappa Theta Pi, a professional tech fraternity, where I maintain 
                and expand a cross-platform app used by 400+ users for internal operations and recruitment.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                My technical projects include SongSync, a mood-based playlist generator that uses Spotify's API and
                audio features to curate personalized listening experiences; MScribe, a Chrome extension that
                auto-summarizes UMich lecture transcripts using AI and RAG; and a Drone Delivery Optimizer, which uses
                graph algorithms to calculate efficient delivery routes. I've developed these tools using Python, C++,
                React, Flutter, Firebase, FastAPI, and more, always with a focus on user experience and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Outside of coding, I'm a DJ who performs at venues around Ann Arbor, a podcast host, and a storyteller
                at heart. My goal is to keep building tech that resonates with people and creates space for creativity,
                clarity, and connection. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
