                        <p> As the VP of Marketing of the Michigan Music Business Club,
                            I led the implementation of a dynamic content creation system that significantly enhanced
                            our presence on TikTok and Instagram,
                            achieving a 139% boost in interaction and reach with an expansion from 450 to over a
                            thousand followers.
                            I spearheaded several successful campaigns including 'New Music Friday', 'Trivia Tuesday',
                            and 'Artist/Member Spotlights'
                            that notably increased engagement and improved brand visibility across Spotify and Instagram
                            platforms.
                            Additionally, I initiated and managed the 'B Major Podcast', which featured 8 in-depth
                            interviews and
                            discussions on crucial music industry topics, accumulating more than 200 hours of watch time
                            and
                            enriching our audience's industry knowledge.

                            analyzing engagement metrics to identify high-performing content for improvement, resulting
                            in a 25% increased performance. I orchestrated tailored marketing campaigns integrating SEO
                            optimization and content calendars, boosting artist visibility by 40% and increasing
                            streaming numbers by 55% across Spotify and Apple Music. During my time, I had the pleasure

                        <p> SongSync aims to solve the challenge of finding the ideal playlist for any mood, offering a
                            unique and tailored musical journey every time.
                            It is a web application designed to revolutionize playlist creation through advanced audio
                            analysis and mood-based curation.
                            The project involves implementing various methods to sort and manage audio tracks
                            effectively, focusing on features such as energy, tempo, and danceability to ensure each
                            playlist is harmonically and rhythmically cohesive.
                            By integrating with the Spotify API, SongSync accesses users' top artists and creates
                            personalized playlists directly on their profiles.
                            The application employs sophisticated algorithms to match users' selected moods with tracks
                            from their favorite artists, computing mood scores to curate the perfect listening
                            experience.

                            we created
                            M-Scribe, a Chrome extension designed to revolutionize the way students interact with their
                            academic content. This tool enhances UMich lecture experiences by combining a React frontend
                            with a Flask backend, incorporating cutting-edge AI technologies for real-time lecture
                            analysis and summarization. M-Scribe not only reduces student study time by 40% but also
                            improves comprehension through features like advanced AI-driven note-taking and content
                            summarization. It's about making every study session as productive as possible, freeing up

                            deletion capabilities, which significantly improved control over data management.
                            Additionally, I pioneered the development of iOS widgets and transformed comprehensive
                            search functionality using Dart/Flutter. This work not only enhanced navigation efficiency
                            for our members but also integrated Google Sheets API for more efficient updating of rushee

                            To simplify the process of finding and leasing properties, I incorporated location-based
                            search and filtering features.
                            Finally, I utilized responsive design principles to ensure optimal performance across
                            various devices and screen sizes.

                            databases.
                            The program used hash tables to handle large datasets efficiently, mimicking real-world
