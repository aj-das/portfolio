                Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Arinjoy (AJ) Das, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of
                Michigan. Go Blue! From an early age, I've been passionate about blending technology with my interests.
                My journey in Computer Science, sparked by an interest in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, led
                me to the University of Michigan. My work lives at the intersection of tech, storytelling, and culture.
                Most recently, I accepted an offer to join Wells Fargo as a 2025 Technology Intern, and I previously
                interned at 740 Project, where I conducted social media audits and created data-driven marketing
                strategies that increased artist engagement by over 70%.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                On campus, I’m currently Co-President of the Michigan Music Business Club, where I’ve led major artist
                partnerships (including Don Toliver, Cordae, and 24kGoldn), organized a podcast series, and spearheaded
                a full-scale digital revamp that more than doubled engagement across platforms. I also serve as Director
                of App Development for my professional tech fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi, where I implemented new features
                and maintain the KTP Life app. It's a cross-platform tool with over 1,900 downloads that supports
                communication and recruitment for nearly 400 users.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                My technical projects include SongSync, a mood-based playlist generator that uses Spotify’s API and
                audio features to curate personalized listening experiences; MScribe, a Chrome extension that
                auto-summarizes UMich lecture transcripts using AI and RAG; and a Drone Delivery Optimizer, which uses
                graph algorithms to calculate efficient delivery routes. I’ve developed these tools using Python, C++,
                React, Flutter, Firebase, FastAPI, and more, always with a focus on user experience and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Outside of coding, I’m a DJ who performs at venues around Ann Arbor, a podcast host, and a storyteller
                at heart. My goal is to keep building tech that resonates with people and creates space for creativity,
                clarity, and connection. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
            </p>
