                            <p> As the VP of Marketing of the Michigan Music Business Club,
                                I led the implementation of a dynamic content creation system that significantly
                                enhanced

                                thousand followers.
                                I spearheaded several successful campaigns including 'New Music Friday', 'Trivia
                                Tuesday',
                                and 'Artist/Member Spotlights'
                                that notably increased engagement and improved brand visibility across Spotify and
                                Instagram

                                Additionally, I initiated and managed the 'B Major Podcast', which featured 8 in-depth

                                discussions on crucial music industry topics, accumulating more than 200 hours of watch

                                By integrating with the Spotify API, SongSync accesses users' top artists and creates

                                To simplify the process of finding and leasing properties, I incorporated location-based

                                This project required us to implement priority queues using various methods,
                                including the Poor man's method, a sorted method, a binary heap method, and a pairing
                                heap
                                method,
                                to simulate an efficient escape route from a mine in case of an emergency.</p>
