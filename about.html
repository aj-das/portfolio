                <p class="description">Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Arinjoy (AJ) Das, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Go Blue! From an early age, I've been passionate about blending technology with my interests. My journey in Computer Science, sparked by an interest in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, led me to the University of Michigan, where I delved into data structures, algorithms, and computational mathematics. My experience as an intern at Vibrant NDT Corporation honed my skills in data analysis and resonance testing.</p>

                <p class="description">I've applied my technical expertise in app design and development, notably in the Kappa Theta Pi Life App, where I integrated Google Calendar for innovative scheduling features. As the VP of Marketing for the Michigan Music Business Club, I led initiatives that significantly boosted our social media engagement and revamped our website to enhance user experience. I also spearheaded the "B Major Podcast," driving insightful discussions on key music industry topics.</p>

                <p class="description">My projects, such as SongSync and HomeHunter, demonstrate my ability to create impactful technology solutions. SongSync leverages advanced audio analysis and the Spotify API to create tailored playlists, while HomeHunter simplifies property search and leasing through responsive design and location-based features. Additionally, I developed a drone delivery simulation system utilizing graph algorithms for optimized path computation.</p>

                <p class="description">With my love of music, here's a playlist of songs that are in my rotation right now! My goal is to continue developing accessible, impactful technology solutions that resonate with diverse audiences. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>
